# PhpCrashCourse
Just a very basic crash (and burn) course on PHP essentials

Instructions:
- copy all the files inside the htdocs folder of your Apache installation
- Index.html contains a menu of all other files for easy access and test
- All php files are well commented inside, that's the real interesting part
- the db_dump.sql file can be imported via phpmyadmin and is required for some examples to work
